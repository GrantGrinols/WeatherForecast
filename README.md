#  :partly_sunny: Weather Forecast for Michigan :partly_sunny:
---
### :sunny: Introduction:
Welcome to my Michigan Forecast app. This application features a quick list of big locations in the Michigan. Not only that, it also gives you the forecast of any location.
Behind the scenes, this created to be hosted by the cloud via Microsoft Azure's <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/app-service/overview">App Service</a>, but it could also be hosted locally.

This makes uses of Visual Crossing's API. This API grabs forecasts when given coordinates. This tool does require an API key, you can generate a free one <a href="https://www.visualcrossing.com/">here</a>
Additionally, this also uses a Google Map's API. This API converts a given address/city into coordinates. You can generate an API key <a href="https://console.cloud.google.com/">here</a>(There is a free trial but the features we are using doesn't charge any credit).

### :memo: About:

Something I've always wonder about is to how to make my apps more deliverable - that is, how do I deliver apps to ordinary people who have no experience with computers? The answer to that is with the cloud. With Azure, I am able to host a website on the cloud to make it so that anyone can access that website. The front-end would look pretty with simple instructions and the back-end would be behind the scenes, away from the eyes of the inexperienced and the nerfarious. This project truly was enlightening :man_technologist: .
